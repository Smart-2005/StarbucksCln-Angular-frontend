                    Our story begins in 1971 along the cobblestone streets of Seattle’s historic
                    Pike Place Market. It was here where Starbucks opened its first store, 
                    offering fresh-roasted coffee beans, tea and spices from around the world 
                    for our customers to take home. Our name was inspired by the classic tale, 
                    “Moby-Dick,” evoking the seafaring tradition of the early coffee traders.

                    Ten years later, a young New Yorker named Howard Schultz would walk through these 
                    doors and become captivated with Starbucks coffee from his first sip. After joinin
                    g the company in 1982, a different cobblestone road would lead him to another discovery.
                    It was on a trip to Milan in 1983 that Howard first experienced Italy’s coffeehouses,
                    and he returned to Seattle inspired to bring the warmth and artistry of its coffee culture
                    to Starbucks. By 1987, we swapped our brown aprons for green ones and embarked on our next chapter as a coffeehouse.

                    Starbucks would soon expand to Chicago and Vancouver, Canada and then on to 
                    California, Washington, D.C. and New York. By 1996, we would cross the Pacific
                     to open our first store in Japan, followed by Europe in 1998 and China in 1999.
                      Over the next two decades, we would grow to welcome millions of customers each 
                      week and become a part of the fabric of tens of thousands of neighborhoods all 
                      around the world. In everything we do, we are always dedicated to Our Mission: 
                      With every cup, with every conversation, with every community - we nurture the 
                      limitless possibilities of human connection.
